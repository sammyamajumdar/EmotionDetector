# EmotionDetector

This is my first deep learning project using the Keras library.  
The code trains a 6 layer deep neural network, 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers for 50 epochs with the Adam Optimizer.  
Training Accuracy : 99.86%  
Testing Accuracy : 95.99%  
Train, Test split : 600 images for X_train, 150 images for X_test

You can test out this model using your own photos. Just put in the image path in the img_path variable and run the last cell.
